## Features

### Encryption
With CaesarJaw, you can easily encrypt your text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Simply provide the text and a shift key, and let CaesarJaw do the rest. This feature is perfect for securing your confidential messages.

### Decryption
Have an encrypted message and need to decrypt it? CaesarJaw has got you covered. Input the encrypted text along with the correct shift key, and watch as your message is revealed.

### Shift Key Finder
If you have a Caesar Cipher encrypted text but don't know the shift key used, CaesarJaw can help you find it. Let CaesarJaw analyze the text and determine the most likely shift key to decrypt the message.

### Brute-Force Decryption
In cases where you are unable to find the correct shift key, CaesarJaw offers a brute-force decryption feature. This powerful tool will systematically try all possible shift keys until the original message is revealed.
